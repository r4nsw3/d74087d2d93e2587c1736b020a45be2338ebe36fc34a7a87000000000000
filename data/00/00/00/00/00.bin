  |   As a demon army besieges his village, a young ninja ventures          |
  |   through a cursed world, to deliver a scroll paramount to his clan's   |
  |   survival. What begins as a classic action platformer soon unravels    |

  |   Leveraging player expectations as a core design ingredient, The       |
  |   Messenger is first presented as an 8-bit action platformer with a     |
  |   simple story only to turn into an epic time travelling tale,          |
  |   eventually revealing itself as a 16-bit Metroidvania packed with      |
  |   replay value and deadpan humor.                                       |
